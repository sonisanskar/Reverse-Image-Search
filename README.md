Elastic Search, a powerful search and analytics engine known for its scalability and performance. With the introduction of version 8 and above, Elastic Search has added support for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search and vector type fields. These features are integral to our Reverse Image Search technology. By creating indexes directly on Elastic Search, we leverage its ability to handle the load of social media scale content efficiently. This ensures that our vector search service can quickly and accurately process search requests, providing users with timely and relevant results.
